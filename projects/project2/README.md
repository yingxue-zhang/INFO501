## Deliverables
* STAGE 1: Project Proposal.
Each group will turn in a typed proposal document (about 2 pages) defining the finalized project. You should have thought about your proposed work, and possibly tried to solve some initial part of it. Make sure to have dug in enough to understand the feasibility of your proposed direction, and/or to have looked at the necessary background knowledge and skills needed to pursue the project. This proposal should explain the proposed work to be done. You should also list relevant environment (tools) you have set up or papers you have read in order to succeed to complete the project. Do provide an expected schedule for your planned completion, including a list of tasks to be undertaken week by week, and the deliverables for the end of the course.<br>

* Stage 3: Final Project.
The complete project is delivered. You are expected to produce and submit a professional report on your project, complete with a clear motivation, full description with examples, and careful evaluation of the effectiveness of the solution. In addition, the presentation and demonstration of your solution, as appropriate, will be done in class by each team. We'll determine the exact time allowed per project later. See below to learn about what aspects should be stressed in this presentation.<br>
This presentation must be supplemented with a final project report due at the same time. This report should be a well-written technical report describing your project. It is fine and in fact likely that this report will be a direct extension of your progress report. Depending on the nature of your project, it will need to contain a detailed description of your data set, of your system, key technologies used, experimental charts, sample runs, a detailed analysis of the results. The report typically is about 10 pages.

* Stage 3: Final Presentation.



## Grading
* **PDF Report (40 points)**
* **Presentation (30 points)**
* **Code (30 points)**

**Project Grading in General**

The final grade of the team project (which may not necessarily be the same for each member of the team) will be based on :
* the difficulty of the project you have chosen to work on, and the effort you have put into formulating your problem and identifying relevant techniques to solve your problems,
* your solution approach and techniques utilized and the quality and effort of execution,
* the oral project presentation (covering the problem your group tackled, your solution approach, and your results at the end of the course),
* the written documentation of your project in the form of a report (which you will make accessible to other students in the class),
* the demonstration of your data analysis (including visualizations, preproccessing and models), as applicable and
* the understanding of each team member of his or her part of the project, as well as of the overall group product.
